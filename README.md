This website was built to establish a presence on the web for an active pet grooming business in Las Vegas, Nevada. At the client's request, I've adopted the style of a website I built previously for another grooming business - Lisa's Pampered Paws in Reno Nevada - which has successfully generated regular new business leads for them.  The clients are expanding into Las Vegas and asked for a quick turnaround on a new website to begin  generating new leads.  I purchased the domain for them (ogtailwaggers.com) and created an A record in the DNS settings to serve the site from my GitHub Page.  Planned enhancements include a Blog, a "Specials" page, and eventually, scheduling functionality on the Book Appointment page (the business owners preferred not to offer online booking at this time).
